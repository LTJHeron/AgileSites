# AgileWCS 0.3 (Rick)

(Status: Development Branch - it will stabilize hopefully soon)

This project is an Agile Development framework for Oracle WebCenter Sites.

The framework is tested currently  with WCS 11gR1 
Sample sites can be imported *ONLY* in WCS 11gR1  
(mostly because of bugs in previous versions of CSDT).

Framework can also be built and may work with Fatwire 7.6 
but it is not currently tested in this environment.

Check the [AgileWCS_book.pdf|AgileWCS book] for the complete documentation.
