# Tutorial

This tutorial teaches how to use AgileSites in the form of a step-by-step guide to create a new site.

## Prerequisites

The framework **requires** you develop in your local machine with a local installation of Sites and share code and content model through a version control system. 

However this is not a limitation. The JumpStartKit (a locally installable version of Sites) is available from Oracle support to customers. It is convenient because it is very easy to install and includes all you need for development.

Furthermore it is possible to [install Sites in your computer](http://www.sciabarra.com/fatwire/2012/04/09/download-and-install-a-development-fatwire-instance-also-on-mac/) for development purposes. You can install it without Oracle or you may also use the free Oracle XE.

If your habit is to develop on a shared instance and you want to keep working that way, then AgileSites is probably not fit for your way of working.

Once done, follows the [installation](Install.md) steps. You do not require the demo site, although it is convenient to have it installed during development.
