# AgileWCS 0.3

This is an Agile Development framework for Oracle WebCenter Sites.

The framework works with Fatwire 7.6, WCS 11g and 11gR1

However sample sites can be imported  *ONLY* in WCS 11gR1  
(mostly because of bugs in previous versions of CSDT).

See 
- [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.
- [DEVELOPMENT](DEVELOPMENT.md) for development procedure.
- [CSDT](CSDT.md) for CSDT integration
