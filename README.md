# AgileWCS 0.3

This project is an Agile Development framework for Oracle WebCenter Sites.

The framework is tested  with WCS 11gR1 

Sample sites can be imported  *ONLY* in WCS 11gR1  
(mostly because of bugs in previous versions of CSDT).

Framework has support for building also with Fatwire 7.6 but it is not tested often in that environment.


See:

- INSTALL.md for installation instructions.
- DEVELOPMENT.md for development procedure.
- CSDT.md for CSDT integration
