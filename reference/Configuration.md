Position of this file may vary, in JSK it is located in 

wcsHome folder, in the full installations it is usually stored in a subdirectory.

It is recommended to download the latest patch from the support site where the latest jar can be found.

`wcsUrl in ThisBuild` 

Points to the url to access content server.

Please DO NOT include a slash at the end.
Include the protocol (http or https), the port and the  path to ContentServer (for example /cs ).

This url must  expose Content Server servlets (ContentServer, CatalogManager), so it is generally available only in development (on live site, the /cs/Satellite/site prefix is added by an Apache Proxy so the '/cs/' is inaccessible)
