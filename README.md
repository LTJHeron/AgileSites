# AgileWCS 0.3

This is an Agile Development framework for Oracle WebCenter Sites.

The framework works with Fatwire 7.6, WCS 11g and 11gR1

However sample sites can be imported  *ONLY* in WCS 11gR1  
(mostly because of bugs in previous versions of CSDT).

See

- <a href="AgileWCS/DEVELOPMENT.md">DEVELOPMENT</a> for development procedure.
- <a href="AgileWCS/CSDT.md">CSDT</a> for CSDT integration
