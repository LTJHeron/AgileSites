# Tutorial

With this tutorial you can learn how to use AgileSites  creating a new site in Oracle WebCenter Sites.

## Prerequisites

The framework **requires** you develop in your local machine with a local installation of Sites.  You are expected to share code and content model through a version control system. 

However this is not a limitation. The JumpStartKit (a locally installable version of Sites) is available from Oracle support to customers. It is convenient because it is very easy to install and includes everthing you need for development.

Furthermore it is possible to [install Sites in your computer](http://www.sciabarra.com/fatwire/2012/04/09/download-and-install-a-development-fatwire-instance-also-on-mac/) for development purposes. You can install it without Oracle (using Hypersonic SQL **version 1.8.0**) or you may also use the free Oracle XE.

**NOTE** If your habit is developing on a shared instance with Sites Explorer and you want to keep working that way, then AgileSites is probably not fit for your way of working.

Once you installed Sites, follows the [installation](Install.html) steps to install AgileSites. Note you do not require the installation of the demo site, although it is convenient to have it installed during development.

Once both Sites and AgileSites is installed, please [go here](Configuration.html) to learn how to configure the site.
