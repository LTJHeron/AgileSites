# ScalaWcs #

Welcome.

ScalaWCS is a Scala framework allowing development in Scala 
for the Oracle WebCenter Sites CMS
(formerly Fatwire ContentServer).

It currently supports WCS 11g and Fatwire 7.6. 
It is tested for now only in a JSK 11g on OSX and in a JSK 7.6.2 on Windows.

## Purpose

It tries to improve the developer experience 
offering some interesting features:

- Templates are coded in Scala, not in JSP
- A simplified [[API]] leveraging Scala is available to make development easier.
- Embedded XML in scala is used to generate markup
- No special plugins are needed to edit code, just use Eclipse or any other IDE with Scala support.
- A build system based on SBT is part of the framework
- Agile development: you don't need to restart the app server to pickup changes, a continuos deploy feature is provided
- All the existing API, including tag and java, are accessible by scala
