You need Oracle WebCenter Sites 11g (available from Oracle WebSite) or Oracle JumpStart Kit (available on Oracle Support) to use this framework.

You need also a Java Development Kit (not Java Runtime) to use it.

If you have those, copy build.sbt.dist to build.sbt, edit it to configure and run agilesites.bat on Windows or run agilesites.sh on Linux/MacOSX.

All the documentation is online on http://www.agilesites.org
