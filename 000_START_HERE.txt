You need either the full Oracle WebCenter Sites (available from Oracle WebSite) or Oracle WebCenter Sites JumpStart Kit (available on Oracle Support) to use this framework.

Supported versions are 11.1.1.6.x and 11.1.1.8.0. Version 7.6.x may compile with it but it has not been tested.


You need also a Java Development Kit (not just tte Java Runtime) to use it, version 1.7 or greated. 

Jdk 1.6 (aka Java 6) does not work.

Both java and javac must be available on path. 

IMPORTANT: java and javac in the path must be the same used to run JSK or Fatwire/Sites.

To start, execute either agilesites.cmd or agilesites.sh. It will popup a configurator. You have to provide the main directory of your installation.

If the configurator cannot locate it, you must also provide the csdt jar location and the webapp location.

All the documentation is online on http://www.agilesites.org
